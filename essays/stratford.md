This matches pretty closely with the general stratford crest (Lion Variation)

![G.H.S. Arms](https://ianfhunter.github.io/images/GHSarmsS.gif)

There is some sign of the arm being cuffed in the second grave, but it is too hard to tell to confirm. Also the head of the lion is too worn to confirm if it is langued. The arm is Detexer (i.e. Right-Side)

Color of the stripes would help determine which branch of the Stratford family this is, however likely descendant from the Irish Stratfords originally from the House of Warwickshire - Though not the Arlbourough branch.
