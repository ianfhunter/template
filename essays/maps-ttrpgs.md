In order to create a believable map, you should follow natural geographic patterns, however, traditional maps can be boring themselves, or fantastical areas of vast magnitude can be hard to populate when you go into detail.

First, any map you give a player should have multiple areas for investigation, even if that may not be initially obvious. I recommend 4 hooks.
It's okay to leave a map bare in appearance, as long as it's useful - think, why would someone *need* to make a map at this scale if it was all the same.
