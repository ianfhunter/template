In one of my past workplaces, I went to a introductory day where we had motivational speakers encourage us to 'be our best' and all the other cliché phrases you can imagine.

However, there was one question they asked to the room, that I can't get myself to agree with.
The concept of specialization.

The attitude was that by pidgeon-holing yourself into a role, you would become far more valuable to employers who needed that skill. But how many employers have the same technologies as the ones before? When you move roles, you always have to learn something new. Maybe you are a C# Expert, but what if your next role integrates with some new DSL? The language knowledge won't protect you from new algorithms in particular domains.

On the other hand, if you are exposed to lots of technologies, you have a larger pool of experiences to have seen similar patterns. You can advise outside of your corner of the code and can add value through secondary tools. In most of my jobs, I've written *some* sort of visualization tool, and they have been invaluable at speeding up development. On the other hand, I see older engineers trudging through work inefficiently.
