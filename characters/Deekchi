Deekchi, like many Samsarans, has lived many lives. Many of those memories have gone with those lives, but some linger on. A few places remain in her memory and in this life at least, she tries to piece them together.
Her latest expedition, to a plague-ridden island, should've provided clues and hopefully some tangental findings to fund her research. But her boat was wrecked and she was confined to the island, and sadly, her companions were not as tough.
So she finds herself as a hermit, camped out in a quarry, trying to survive and holding out some small hope to escape.

Her memories are a haze and sometimes it can be hard to tell which life was what, or if something was a dream or reality. Some connections have preserved through her lives - an innate magical talent, a strong arcane bond to a certain elemental patron, and her relentless curious nature.

Being alone for 6 months has started to affect her, as it would anyone. Her only companion, her toad familiar is the only one she can talk to, and she cannot talk back. At least it's not talking to herself - now that would be insane.
