# Backstory

Dazzle came from an enclave of various sprites, fairies and others. They lived a happy life deep in the forest, occasionally venturing into the material plane to play with the village folk nearby.
However, a new resident of the village arrived, and they didn’t have the same respect for the fae as the others did, and when Dazzle tried to play a small harmless trick on them, they swung their hatchet at him, swearing.
Several more incidents happened with the other sprites as the townspeople changed their views and before long, the community had hired gold-focussed adventurers to cross the plane and stop them. The band of adventurers tore down their homes from the trees and ripped their wings off, several of his friends were killed.
Dazzle survived, but not without damage. He had his wings plucked, and their loss tore him up inside - he had lost both his biggest pride and his flight. While the community was trying to recoup itself, a hag wandered into the chaotic scene, feigning assistance. 
Distraught, Dazzle asked her if there was anything that could be done to help them, or help him - and she nodded. Shown to her hut, Dazzle followed her in a strange ritual, drawing chalk circles and lighting black candles.
 After it was done, he felt a wondrous sensation - his wings were back! And as good as ever. He saw their reflection in a mirror inside the hut - They looked amazing. The faint camouflaged lines were now a shimmering crimson trim, and the fake eye patterns seemed to really follow you.

He ran back to the enclave, but instead of delight, he was received with disgust. It was unheard of to deal with hags and devils, and he was cast out. There was no-one left there who could plead his case.

Teary-eyed and broken-hearted, Dazzle flew as far as he could. Over the forest treetops, over lakes and hillside, stopping now and then for a reluctant recuperation. 
Over the years, Dazzle came accustomed to the travelling life, but ultimately found it unrewarding. He missed the frivolities of the fae, the banter with the townsfolk, the sense of having a family. He aired his woes to the newest bartender, who suggested a guild as a place of homeliness  - and the finest one of all was the Raven’s mark in Corvus.

Dazzle died to a pack of wolves with his adventuring companions, Dabura and Katherine
