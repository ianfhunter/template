# Backstory
Scattelli comes from a long line of rich high elves, many close comrades of royalty and other worldly leaders.

They specialise in antiques and have the market, but for the Coltina family who they have contested generation after generation for. It is a sure sore spot then, that Scattelli has fallen for a fair daughter of that family - Eldara. 

Scattelli joins an adventuring party to gain further reknown for himself, that he may return a powerful man and he may overturn old family feuds and marry his love.
