# Backstory

Areitistrael was an aasamir like any other up in Mount Celestia. She fought in some wars in her youth, visited the weak and frail on the material plane, standard good guy stuff. As a distant descendant of Kelemvor, she mostly ferried the dead to peace. 

She didn’t know her parents well. She call recall vague memories, but not even their faces. They sent her off for celestial service at a young age, only recieving letters from them annually. She tried writing back, but they did not seem to reach them, and her questions were never answered.

As she grew older, she grew over confident in her trips to the material plane, not taking her standard security cautions and protections each time she went down. Many of her kind were naive, living in bliss and not having to worry for most of their lives, so she fell easily for a hidden fiend’s plot. 

A dying old mute man wanted to share his memories with her, before he passed, so she could share them with his family. As they joined consciousnesses, a possessing demon jumped from his mind to hers.

Over the next few years, Areitistrael worked against the internals of the heavens, some small transgressions at first, until she was finally convinced to deal a real blow.

When she was caught, she was stripped of most of her divine abilities, her flight - all but that which was natural. They wiped all of her mind but that that would keep her sane, and exiled her to the material plane, never to return.

Areitistrael got into lots of subsequent trouble after that, all from her own doing (with thanks to the fiend’s influence). Lacking her divine power, she leant on more of those powers from her parasite.

Over the years, the fiend swapped souls and demons in and out of her head, each taking a heavy mental toll on Areitistrael. The latest of which, Dazzle, another soul in service to the same fiend - saved from the hellish abyss with another deal struck with the fiend. 
When Dazzle entered, the fiend themselves left. Leaving her still possessed, but without quite so much effectiveness on her autonomy. Since this event, which was innoculous for her, but importantly strategic for the fiend, a message pressed on her mind from the new voice - the two words “Raven’s Mark”. She didnt know it might be malicious yet, so she followed it.
