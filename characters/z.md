# Backstory
Zhetsizheih, known outside the Yuan-Ti as simply “Z”, wasn’t always a city-dweller. For the last 30 years of his life, he spent it in Anauroch, a soldier under the service of another Yuan-Ti  “Yuzshuthia” who controlled their clan with strong telekinesis.


He was part of their calvary, a mighty force who rode upon giant lizards. Their last expedition was when Z escaped. They were raiding ruins of an old long-dead dragon’s lair. Whilst he was scouting out, he felt a psychic pull from beneath the old giant skeleton, when he investigated, he discovered a single scaled egg.

As he removed it from its resting place, he felt his mind snap. The connection with Yuzshuthia had been broken. He could think for himself again.

Z snuck out of the lair with the egg, signalling to the others that it was clear to enter. As they explored and looted, Z took his mount and rode West, riding for days at a time. Eventually he found towns and cities large enough to become anonymous in. 

Z joined the adventurer’s guild after hearing of their reputation for accepting warriors from any background with open arms. Between journeys, Z runs a stall in Neverwinter’s bazaar, selling spices and exotic material with thanks to some carefully re-established connections with Anauroch. 

It was an unremarkable day when the egg hatched. Z was closing up shop and felt that familiar tug at his mind. When he went to check on the egg, he discovered it was open and a shiny platinum dragon chick was inside, gnawing at parts of the eggshell. It spoke, it already had a name - Zezzapho, and Z had unknowingly given it a title “The stolen lady”.

Z and Zezzapho were strong battle companions, friends and even business partners - the unfamiliar sight drawing many a curious face to their stall.

However, one night, under the cover of darkness, an unknown assassin crept into Z’s chambers and attacked him. Z fought him off, but in the midst of the fight Zezzapho was slain - the baby dragon too fragile to properly defend his partner. 

Z could only barely afford to commission a healer to restore his dragon companion to life, Z now spends his time training and investigating to who the perpetrator could be. Initial suspicions were on fellow stall owners, but none seemed to be in such a wealthy position to hire assassins. Who could it be?
