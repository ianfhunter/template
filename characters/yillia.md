# Backstory
Having lived most of her life in the wilderness with a handful of others, Yilla is a proficent huntswoman and survivalist. A casual member of the Emerald Enclave, she and her companions kept watch over the mostly-peaceful vale where they resided. Occasionally, she would travel to enlist the help of the Enclave to assist with moregerous threats.

Yillia started training seriously after the Mud Sorcerer, Miraj Vizann, threw the local sect of the enclave into disarray - slaughtering some of her dearest friends. She swore revenge on the sorcerer and his minions, determined to prevent such a catastrophe should it ever occur again

Yillia is a spritely woman with boundless enthusiasm. She throws herself into everything, sometimes to a fault - one cannot count on their fingers the sticky situations the lure of drunken glee has gotten her into, or the times she has thrown her fists before the conversation has ended. Yillia treasures companionship and is a prime example of loyalty. Her true home is the wilderness, but she enjoys the city life and revels in its differences. However, sometimes urbanites are too dismissive of her natural home for her liking..

# Personality
I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.
Change. Life is like the seasons, in constant change, and we must change with it.
An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me
I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants.
