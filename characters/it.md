Lived with both mother and father, both also fauns. It was a comfortable life in terms of lifestyle, but as a family, they were always at each others necks. Fauns really were suited to a more solitary life, and eventually he got fed up and left, leaving his mother alone , after his father left in disgrace a few years earlier

Originally, It worked as a Tanner in his father's place, but when he left, he became a healer.

At one point, his services called him out to a hag's cottage, but it was a trap and he was captured there for 3 years before he escaped, though she cursed him as she withered and has had awful luck in work since

A human sage helped nurse him back after the incident. He showed him a little more about how to work with salves and such. However, one day his teacher headed out into the forest, and never returned. I search for this person still.
