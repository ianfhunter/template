#Introduction & Background
Born to two tiefling parents, Frill took both a traditional name of Iados, and a virtue name.
For many years, Frill used *all* her skills to climb into the circles of nobilty. No longer a regular novelty at a tavern music night, Frill eventually performed at more presitgious events, at regional showcases and other such performances.
Soon, she was propositioned as a partner to grand balls and higher events. She was a showpiece to many, and for her, her clients were steps on a ladder.
However, it all turned sour after a public refusal of marriage from one of her clients. The client was so mad that she sent for a secret force to get rid of her, so they would never have to set eyes on her again. She changed hands many times until handed over to the drow.
