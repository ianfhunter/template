#Introduction & Background

Born to two tiefling parents, Garmon and Therella, Frills took both a traditional name of Iados Kaleen, and a virtue name. Her parents both from opposite sides of the land, influencing her speech in sometimes odd ways.

For many years, Frill lived in Waterdeep and used all of her skills to climb into the circles of nobilty. No longer a regular novelty at a tavern music night, Frills eventually performed at far more presitgious events, at regional showcases and other such performances. Her oiling of the hinges of the upper class worked well as she had the skill to back it up.

Soon, she was propositioned as a partner to grand balls and higher events. She was a showpiece to many, and for her, her clients were steps on a ladder. A casual follower of Sune, life was going as planned.

However, Frills shot too high, and a risky set of flirtations and consessions culminated in a public refusal of marriage from one of her clients - Lady C. The client set out to ruin her. 

Even if she had wanted to, Frills had a small family hidden from her public life. Her partner Patience and two children, Grace and Honour

A secret force was sent out to get rid of her, and she was captured in the night. She protested, but her assailants were many. After capture, she spent much of her days in chains. She changed hands many times until eventually she was handed over to the drow.

Her sanity clinging on at the faint hope of escape, to wreak vengeance and to ensure her family is safe
