# Backstory
Shekk, previously known as "Blood-Drinker Shekk", spent a large portion of his youth in the orc hordes, looting and pillaging innocents. After one particular razing of a village, Shekk took a mortal wound from a stray pitchfork. His tribe left him for dead and marched onwards into the next town.
A young woman appeared in his hazy vision, just as he passed out, whispering a goodbye to the world.

To his surprise, he woke in a temple, his wounds patched. He spent a few weeks recovering and reflecting. He was marvelled that despite his actions, the humans treated him with unjudgemental care. Even back home, his peers would berate him for his elven father.

Instead of returning to his troop, he decided to return their kindness by following their god. He travelled to a recommended soldier whom he tutored under before heading out to right those wrongs he had done, and to show others the light.

# Appearance
Covered in war-given scars from decades of fighting, Shekk has thankfully escaped any truly disfiguring wounds. His skin is a muddy green and his figure more slender than usual, pointing to his elven parentage. 
Most of Shekk is covered in mail. On his shoulder are some trinkets of his past and current life. A piece of his old squadron's banner, a symbol of Helm, god of protection, a copper leaf broch - the only thing his father left him.

# Personality
I’m haunted by memories of war. I can’t get the images of violence out of my mind.
I fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.
Independence. When people follow orders blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny. (Chaotic)
I made a terrible mistake in battle that cost many lives—and I would do anything to keep that mistake secret.
