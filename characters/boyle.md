# Summary
Boyle is a Fire Genasi from the island of Volace. More muted in complexion than his brethren, Boyle's skin varies in shades of ash and coal gray, exuding an aura of latent heat. Were it not for his enflamed head, a quick glance might mistake him for a human. Born to an absentee father and a early deceased mother, Boyle has always had to rely on his own perseverance. Even more so in his early teens, when his genasi powers started to change - controlling fire caused lingering sulphuric stenches, black flames and tinder crackled as if in pain.

As word spread of his eerie abilities, Boyle was pushed further and further from the community, until he eventually left of his own accord by taking ship to Breria. Over the next few years, he sustained himself on the land and the occasional kindness of strangers, though he was always sure to have repaid in kind with labour, or other means. Now, with some money to his name, Boyle has heeded an adventurer's call so that he can explore yet more land, to live a life more reliable, and to, maybe, one day call somewhere a permanent home.



# Early Life

It took a long time for Boyle’s mother to conceive and when it finally happened, her new-born child was weak and frail. His heat faded as she cradled him in her arms. As the child’s flames flickered, she became increasingly desperate. In her anguish, she wailed, swore and pleaded to the shadows in the room, for no-one else was there. However, something (or someone) was there, and answered her cries. In exchange for her own life, the presence saved Boyle’s.

Such a feat is not simple, and as Boyle grew, side-effects started to appear. His complexion never restored the genasi signature fire-red, The flame atop his head was weak and his heartbeat, seen in the head-flame’s pulse, had slowed significantly.



# Recent Life

After being socially exiled, Boyle took the opportunity of solitude for introspection. He experimented with his fire’s effects and found he could manipulate more than solely flame - he could redirect smoke, combine and separate particles of ash...

Over the course of several years, he had discovered several new ways to draw his powers. The village had several handed-down stories of magic users - sorcerers, wizards, warlocks. But that was just childhood fairy tales, and he didn’t know anyone like that on Volace.
Scraping together what he could, Boyle decided that he needed to leave in order to learn more about both  himself and the wider world. He has had some success in the new island of Breria, having refined his powers to be more controllable and predictable.



# Religious Affiliation

While Boyle does not follow any gods teachings strictly, he does observe the occasional practice of the God Hephaestus, whose domain encompasses fire.



# Familial Bonds

Boyle's father, an elusive Genie, was never known to him (and thus free for the GM to decide :) perhaps he was a Janni or Efreeti ) - and the one person who would have known, his mother, passed before he could speak. 
Her mother, a human woman, was equally as mysterious to him as his father. She had fled from some unknown past to settle on the island of Volace. Her background was not known to even her closest friend who took Boyle as one of her own after he was left alone in the world. This woman's name was Ezile, a migrant from a harsher land, her dark and leathery skin evidence of it. She cared for a few sole children on the island, many of them whose parents had also left the world, several while travelling.
