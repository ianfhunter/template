Age 0.
Cassus Swiftfoot is born to Jant Swiftfoot & Myldrid Fullhand
Age 24.
Myldrid passes away due to a fever. Cassus starts working for the village's main store for trade
management due to knowing several languages of the region.
Age 38.
Marries Hessia Woodburner, his childhood friend since age 20. They move in together in a new
home built in the village.
Age 42.
Lisna Swiftfoot is born, A feast is held in the village.
Age 52.
A band of rogue orcs attack the town, pillaging and burning the village. After being woken by
strange noises, the family hurry out of their home. Cassus carrying Lisna in his arms.
Upon opening the door they are presented with a scene of horror – black smoke lines the sky and
the earth is red with blood and flame. They decide to run to the Hollowed Weir where they hope to
hide. In their hurry, Hessia slips on the verge and falls on her hands. Turning, Cassus notices a large
burly orc, his chest emblazoned with a crimson moon tattoo – a bandit tribe symbol. Before he can
protest, the orc stands on Hessia's head, forcing it into the dirt. Without hesitation, the orc shifts his
weight and her body becomes motionless. Cassus flees tearfully to the Weir, intent to guard Lisna at
least.
Reality sets in for Cassus as he struggled into the hollows alongside the river. Cradling Lisna, he
mourns Hessia's passing in muffled silence.
Two days pass and Cassus, downheartedly returns to the town hall to find an unknown figure
tending to the wounded lying in makeshift beds around the hall. The figure is priestess Imeril, from
a nearby temple – who saw the smoke of the village and rode down to investigate. Her beautiful
pure figure and intentions touch Cassus and he reminds himself that he still has Lisna, and swears to
protect her from a similar fate.
Age 53.
Out of a job (for the store also burnt to the ground) and a permanent home, Cassus invests his
savings into setting up his own apothecary, inspired by the elven priestess's compassion. Word
spreads and the grand opening is attended by several druids of neighbouring towns – eager to offer
assistance and advice for his store. Slowly but surely, Swiftfoot Apothecary gains reputation
throughout the region as a reliable place to source medicines and ingredients.

Cassus turns to Silvanus, goddess of Wild Nature – the main deity of the elven priestess's temple.
With Imeril's guidance with her casual visits and through self research, he learns to respect the
impulsiveness, naturalness of the world and its creatures.
Because of the shared knowledge of the temple, Cassus is able to source rare plants and animals
inside the nearby forest, which he brings back to his apothecary.

Age 57
The temple invites Cassus to participate in their annual Dryad Dance. They walk deep into the
Ankhwood and start dancing wildly, their limbs flailing with no obvious rhythm and humming in
words he doesn't understand. The sunlight fades behind the trees and is replaced with a strange dim
green light from all directions. Extra movement appears behind the dancers and he captures
glimpses of slender elven-looking figures dancing along.
The physical effort of dancing begins to tire him despite the situtation's wonderious curiosities and
as he slows down, he feels enveloped by a peaceful presence. When he opens his eyes he sees
glowing dust floating in the air above him, sitting up one of the Dryads is before him, dancing alone
with magnificent flexibility and grace. As Cassus is enraptured, flowers bloom around him and for
as far as he can see. Still feeling weak, cassus slowly drifts into slumber again.
This time, Cassus is awoken by raindrops falling on his face. He finds himself closely entwined
within the bark of a tree, his head peaking out from the wood. Hungry, he wrests himself out from
the bark and lowers himself to the ground. The ground is littered with various petals of plants he
recognises and does not. In the midst of them a strong sprout grows – about a foot high.
Cassus feeds on some berries and fruit and looks around for signs of the forest he remembers. It
takes a full 3 days for him to return to his village. His daughter is in tears when he arrives back.
Swiftfoot Apothecary's stock noticeably increases in quality.

Age 59.
Cassus Swiftfoot is accepted into the circle of druids, after learning of their ways for several years.
Lisna turns 17 and begins helping her father in the store and manual gathering.
Age 82.
Word of the new continent reaches the village and so do rumours of great evil in it's unexplored
regions. Many of the village fear that the empire may be overthrown if they further investigate the
land.
Age 84.
After several horrific reports from incoming travellers about the new continent, Cassus decides to
leave the store to Lisna in the hope the position will attract a desirable suitor. With his largest tie to
the village severed, Cassus decides to accompany a traveller on the way to the northernmost port
and investigate the land for himself. Motivated to scout out the power of the creatures of this land,
both for his own druidic research, and for the threat to his country – and thus, his village.
Boarding the boat to Yormand, he notices most of the crew are also adventurers, but motivated by
coin, not the protection of the continent. Most of them are unfriendly and he spends the days
watching the waves on the deck, silently missing his home.
