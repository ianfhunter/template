# Backstory
The Thrük are one of several nomadic tribes that reside in the great Raurin desert of Faerun,
wandering endlessly to live off the barrenness of the sands.
Born in the midst of a sandstorm, Nazeem grew up amongst them as a particularly gifted young
warrior. Rumours appeared that she had not blood, but sand in her veins - for her ability to fight,
even blind, was unparalleled in the group.
The desert had grown harsher in the last few generations of the tribe, and there was a real
threat of the group fading into history - Previous external favours were looking for repayment,
the Thri-kheen which often disrupted their trails were increasing in numbers and several
important members of the group had died - including Nazeem’s father - and witchdoctor of the
group - Neesh.
Without her knowledge, the tribe organized to wed Nazeem to a member of the Qahtan tribe in
order to pay off a large portion of their debt. When her husband-to-be arrived in the village with
the ceremony to commence in two days time, Nazeem vehemently resisted, and broke the nose
of her potential groom, greatly worsening relations between the Thrük and the Qahtan groups.
Instead, she offered to leave the tribe until she made enough money to clear the tribe’s debt and
in doing, return it to its former stature.
Nazeem wields a large bladed fan, one of several traditional weapons of the Thrük. which she
uses to direct and contort the sand - blinding those she pummels brutally. Alternatively she
shields herself from the deserts buffeting or folds it for some pummelling.
While he was still alive, her father passed on some small incantations to bring the warmth of
desert sands wherever she went, but Nazeem was more interested in martial defence and
declined more of his teachings for further combat training.
Shortly after leaving the desert, a travelling caravan overheard her musing on her drums outside
one of the village entrances - enticed by the promise of further travel and money, Nazeem
joined the troupe for a few tours, but Nazeem grew hungry for combat after so long without it
and left the group, along with its leader for a career change
