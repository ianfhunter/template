# Backstory
Æsc, the result of a fling between a certain halfling and a dryad on a hot summer’s eve was a halfdryad. And as such, Æsc always felt somewhat out of place in the feywild - Dryads and the other inhabitants were always so skittish and carefree. Æsc drew little from his mother’s heritage, his hair the only indicator of his ancestry - in all other ways, Æsc was no different to a person of a pure mortal birth. Often neglected or ignored by the fey, Æsc’s life drifted by with nothing to show for it.

Then, a few days after his 21st birthday, he was summoned to meet one of the archfey. An audience with a member of the archfey was a great privilege and refusal was not an option. Although, noone - especially not Æsc - knew why he would be given this privilege, seeing as much of fey society frowned upon him.
Æsc found it hard to follow exactly what the archfey wanted from him, its slyvan was ancient and obscure, it meandered from topic to topic and was vague on any details. But the overarching request was clear - Æsc was to travel to the mortal realm in order to fufill a task for the archfey. Without explicit instructions, the archfey were sure Æsc would arrive at the right time to the right place, and only then it would be revealed what exactly his purpose was. To assist him, the archfey granted Æsc some of their power, and they signed a pact together. The whole process took a mere twenty minutes, and most of that was spent in some incomprehensible tangent related to how the ivy in the south of the country wasn’t quite as green as the ivy in the north. Æsc assumed he was a pawn in a much larger scheme, but there was no following fey logic it was both too complex and ever changing to predict. So, Æsc packed his bags and walked out of the feywild and into the mortal plane alone. He didn’t bother to pass on farewells to his mother or any of the fey he knew - they were distant and probably wouldn’t have noticed him leaving.

Æsc travelled Faerun and made friends, discovered places of intense beauty, settled arguments, delivered important messages, found love and ate many delicacies, but his task was never revealed to him. Upon hearing of ships entering a new continent, Æsc presumed he should investigate if his place was somewhere on this new land. With a letter sealed with an important lord’s stamp, he crossed the sea with with an adventuring party of men and dwarves - set to find a rare material to bring back for the empire.
