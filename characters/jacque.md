# Backstory 

I used to be just like my brothers and sisters. So much so, that at least 4 others in my troupe were called Slippery Jack, At least my parents were more imaginative. Although, I suppose, there were only so many varieties of mushroom living in their corner of the underdark to name ourselves after. It was when I turned 60 that everything changed. 

Reckless adventurers stampeded through our land on their way to face the dark shadowy ruler of their quadrant. This was no new event, but it seemed they were endless now. Very few of them passed us, but over time our gardens were trampled into the dirt, our homes burned away and our people started to die out.
I watched as each one from our troop died, until it was just Chanterelle and I. Chanterelle was my dearest friend, and we had saved each other multiple times from those invaders. 

We decided to take the fight back to the surface, though quickly realised we were far too weak, even for the beasts that dwelled in the other crevices of the underdark. We had never been outside our home before. We needed help. So, we hiked our way to talk to the shadowy dealer, who pleasantly agreed - we would be able to harness the power of all those who died, letting them lend us their strength for the way forward. He told us it was perfect that there were two “vessels”

All I could hear was screams, Chanterelle’s screams. Her body was twisting and contorting in ways it shouldn't have been able to do. Spectral streams seemed to be rushing inside her, and yet, she seemed to be hardening, and shrivelling. I couldn’t watch.

When I did open my eyes, it was because he had grabbed me. In his hand he had a glowing spectral, vined heart. I knew without asking that it was Chanterelle. As my mouth gaped in confusion, I felt my chest torn open, and Chanterelle thrust inside. As quickly as he began, he threw me out, back to my path, sobbing.

It was then I understood why the adventurers were coming. But I still hated them, and as I travelled, wandering, I found the heart was what we had asked for. It did make me strong, I began to be able to use magic. But as much as it was a gift, it was a curse. I didn’t have  a chance to forget what he had done, the scars still on me, my magical gifts often uncomfortably tainted.

Over the next few decades, I fought, bought, fled and fumbled my way to the surface, eager to find the source of the onslaught of adventurers, but to my surprise - there was none. They were all freelancers, spurred on by the thrill of danger and the reward of treasure. They were also, surprisingly accommodating - once we didn't meet in a dark corridor, or underground. It was strange, because they were the nicest places. The sun burnt my flesh and made my eyes dry. I invested in a cloak, and even those rudest exemplaries in the town started to bear me no mind. It was somehow comfortable, despite the odd culture.

In the end, I needed more money to sustain my investigations, and after endless rejection, I became the very thing that drove me here. An adventurer. However, adventuring in the underdark was well away from me now, I was more suited to clearing out the rats in the innkeeper’s basement and silencing nuisance folk.
