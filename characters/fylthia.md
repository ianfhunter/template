# Backstory
Originally Flythia's parents set sail to get away from all the goblin fighting. She wanted to fight real enemies, not bicker amongst their own kind. As far as she was concerned, goblin loot was goblin loot - no matter who had claim to it.

She grew up on the ship "Searipper" and while she enjoyed the skirmishing battles and the celebrating after, she longed for a life on the land. Every time they stopped at a port, it seemed so exciting. There was drinking! music! people selling all kinds of stuff, especially on the side alleys. It seemed a much better life.

Finally, at age 8, she became a grown woman and her parents had no longer any sway in her decision. She took off in the night at the next port stop and ran as fast as her small legs could carry her. 
A few miles out, she found a hunting party of the Shagaan Band. She instantly clicked with them, and so she spent the time putting her pirating experience into practise - on land!

After a full year of travel, they finally returned back to the main encampment, and Flythia was delighted to see other goblins of all sizes and types. She made some good friends there, and even better enemies.

The recent raids on the goblin villages have rudely intruded on her daily goblin life, and she wants to protect it. And grab all their money while she's at it.
