# Backstory
Nyspora always had something to grumble about in the clan. The elders were too focused on tradition and resistant to change, festivities and celebrations sorely paled in comparison to the dwarves and orcish tribes nearby. Everything was just so boring! So, Nyspora took matter into her own hands. However, Nyspora was smart enough to take precaution not to be caught. She encouraged the younger, and more *mallable* members of the clan into participating in her pranks. 

However, what she had in smarts and trickery, she also had in impatience and short temper. Her more capable peers wised up to her plots and Nyspora was increasingly outed as the perpetrator. This led to many a rampage through the nearby woods, broken branches and ripped off bark.
Eventually, Nyspora took one step too far and in a blind rage struck out at one of the base poles of the elders' tent. It collapsed and in the ruckus, several of the elders were injured.

She was cast out. Nyspora wandered the lands, looking at other clans, other races, other cultures. She saw the things she lacked in the clan, but she also saw things she didn't know she had - Loyalty, Law, Familial ties. She quickly learned, after a few stops that her trickery was not so tolerated as a traveller. She learned some subtly and she began to write. About the traditions, the livelihoods, but most interesting to her, how everyone, regardless of where they came from, had something they could be manipulated with.

Though travelling aimlessly, Nyspora always had one lingering calling at the back of her mind. A dragon's talon she carried with her. It was as pure white as her own scales. Noone, not even her parents were as white as that. And why did she have it? Her parents did not know, nor anyone in the small clan. But, as a the wind carried tales of a procession heading into the deep snow, Nyspora's interest was piqued. Perhaps she could find out something more...

# Appearance
Nyspora is a snow-white female dragonborn. In comparison to other dragonborn of her clan, her figure is less harsh and rugged, her face longer and her body taller. Something was different in her heritage, though she knew not what. Despite her calmer looks and demeanor, the *real* Nyspora is not one to be taken lightly. An infernal rage and unsettlement seethes inside her and a wrong word can set her off.
