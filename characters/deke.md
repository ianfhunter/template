# Backstory
Deke Shunnery was a brief hit in Faerun with his series of books - "The Complete Goblin", "The Devil's Lexicon", "Speaking With Angels" being just some of them.
Those days have died down now, but he is still held in reasonably high regard in different circles of scholarly types.

His main research area was illusion magic, the languages was a hobby. But they intertwined. The other races had much neglected knowledge to seek out. No avenue to research was too dangerous - Talking with frivilous gods, tempting devils, really.. really stupid giants...  His illusion magic helped many a sticky situation there.

The university forced him out because of his age. Pah! He'll show them, He'll join a young band of adventurers and show them he can still keep kicking! Besides, the best way to get some real monster curses and lingo was to attack them!

The oldest of the mage college, Arthur Itis, enforced a retirement age on the college's members. However, Arthur had a research team of scholars preserving his own body with different ancient spells to argue his own exception to the rule.
Deke took great offense to the call to leave his post. He was just getting started! In the end, they had to enlist the help of the town guard and some of the other senior members of staff to escort him out. He, eventually, went peacefully, but not before causing all sorts of mayhem with his illusions.

The amount of people who would recognise Deke is small. His books were often reference material, books to take up space on one's drawing desk. Perhaps his name might stir some more scholarly people's memories. Most of the people who would recognise his actual face are still disgruntled by his ungracious exit from the university

Deke had only one love, the head of the school of Divination - Clare Voyent - She loved him too, but she could tell that it was never to be.
