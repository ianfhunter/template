Introduction
Windwhistle introduces himself with a sharp shrill noise resembling a loud draught through loose
floorboards in a gale. His plumage is disheveled and patchy, some wounds from battle, others
gained from drunken encounters after dark. Living as a watchman for many years has made
Windwhistle hyper-cautious and alert. At least one beady black eye surveils the party at all 
times, his rapier never too far away.
Hailing from Swynmead, the merchant’s republic, Windwhistle lived out his youth in the busy
port town before taking to the seas for the last 10 years.
Like other kenku, Windwhistle’s dream is to one day be able to fly. Having given up on ever
attaining flight, Windwhistle is content to pursue his next love, the ocean breeze. While his
perch in the Crow's nest of the ship is comfortable it barely pays enough for his board and bread
when on land. Wind whistle has taken to adventuring to fast track his goal of owning his own
ship.
Swynmead and the ships that rest there.
When the seasons change, so does the town of Swynmead.
In spring, traders pile fruits and meats along the docks, ready for loading.
In summer, people from other areas in the continent migrate from the high heat of the mainland
In autumn, fishermen dominate the moorings, hauling in crates upon crates of all varieties of
fish. In winter, sailors take shelter in whorehouses and fireside seats in taverns.
Swymead within the Merchant’s Republic
In this forever changing landscape, it is easy to get lost in the crowds, markets and stacks upon
stacks of crates. Equally, it is convenient for those who do not want to be found - A sizeable
underground community exists of petty thieves and scam artists, who prey on simple travellers.
Windwhistle’s parents (Clanger & Rat) were prominent members of the group, specializing in a
group-organized scam that worked mostly on isolation and threats. They were able to produce
an income stable enough for both of them to live off, however not when Windwhistle arrived.
Reluctantly, Windwhistle quickly fell to many of his own parent’s vices and raised himself on
stolen wallets and purses. Windwhistle never stole from the ships’ cargo though - not after he
tried pursuing a crate of watermelons into a ship’s hold and had the door close behind him. After
a brutal beating he knew not to mess with a muscled crew again.
Happy Clam and Poison Lotus Flags
As he grew, Windwhistle became familiar with many of the regular boats that passed through
the port. An opportunity presented itself to him when, at the conclusion of yet another bar brawl,
he realised one of his combat companions was the captain of the Poison Lotus - who promptly
offered him a place on his ship as a deckhand. Excited, Windwhistle accepted on the spot,
eager to get away from a life of ill repute.
Alas, several weeks passed and it appeared to Windwhistle that sailing life wasn't anything he
imagined. The food was too salty, the sailors too rude, the beds itchy, the pay barely managing
to cover his costs on land. It didn’t seem at all like sealife he was hoping for.
Increasingly, Windwhistle grew cautious of the crew, not a week in they had begun intimidating
other ships into handing over their goods, boarding those who resisted...

While Windwhistle doesn’t know much of Captain Otto, the other crewmembers reckon
that he and his brother are rebellious exiles from the theocracy of Xinyi
But, Windwhistle kept telling himself, experience was experience. If he could bear it for a while,
perhaps he might be able to crew a proper ship - then he would finally be away from the
unsavory life he had always lived.
He didn’t hate the Poison Lotus entirely, in fact those same rough burly men held the most
carefree, intensely enjoyable celebrations that came after some particularly big hauls.
Windwhistle took joy in the salty wind ruffling his feathers and the sudden weightlessness as the
boat jumped over the heavy ocean waves.
A few years passed, but Windwhistle never saw hide nor hair of a more meaningful job than a
deckswab, and he had been craving that position up in the crow’s nest for so long. On return to
Swynmead, he departed the crew and managed to secure another boat’s nest - albeit for the
same wage. After a few days of helping stock the hold, Windwhistle took to the seas again, this
time under the bright sun-emblazoned flag of the ‘Happy Clam’

Captain Wattfield is a rich noble’s son hailing from Ettenstein, continuing the legacy of a
great naval military captain, though his eagerness is not as strong and he has opted for
a more casual life of transporting goods.
Departure for Theaton
Theaton was a regular stop for the happy clam as it to-and-froed from the merchant’s capital to
Ettenstein, It was a convenient half-way point that came into view just as rations were running
low.
Apart from his own familiarity with the city, Windwhistle has another motive for stopping in the
city - a sweet lady, Bee.
Bee is another kenku, so called for the creatures she tends to in her plot. Bee is short for a
kenku, but subtly strong. Living several miles outside of the port town, her physique is toned 
with daily commutes carrying many heavy loads of produce. She is one of several market ladies
who try to flog goods on incoming sailors and passers-through.
Windwhistle fell in love through his stomach, when he tasted Bee’s cooking - somehow she had
made his favourite dish the first time he visited - honey-glazed salmon. Though Windwhistle
would love to stay with her in Theaton and live his days out in her lot, he has become too bound
to the sea and longs to return. It is an ongoing quest to convince Bee to join him once he has
his own ship.
The captain Wattfield has mentioned in confidence that he plans to stop sailing the Happy Clam
soon, so Windwhistle decided to depart the ship in Theaton, and spend some time with Bee
before heading off on his long-planned adventure.
Onwards from Northwood
Windwhistle has big dreams and wants to have his own ship built. To have the security of the
Poison Lotus, the efficiency of the Happy Clam, and perhaps some gnomish ingenuity to fashion
the largest crows nest yet!
While Windwhistle has no plans further than adventuring, he is on the lookout for more financial
opportunities, whether than be gaining a duke’s favour, travelling into the depths of the deserts
or continuing adventuring.
The Merchant’s Republic
Inolis
The Merchant's Republic is a Plutocracy, a form of Oligarchy. The ruling council, dubbed the
"Council of Eight" are comprised of the eight richest mercantile houses in the city of Inolis (Pop
250,000) whose primary concern is staying in power and hoarding wealth.
This is easily done as the surrounding land is rich in precious gems, though extracting them is
dangerous work. Many settlers try and make their fortune in the outlying areas but find
themselves food for Gnolls, Thri-Keen or worse. The land outside the city is mostly ignored by
the council and lawlessness is rampant.
In Clearwater Bay the republic has something very precious, a place where ships going to and
from the western/eastern nations can rest and refuel on the long voyage through the Narrow
Sea. By placing tariffs on trade, docking fees and more, the ruling class have more than enough
money. Their only reliance is food, which they must import in order to feed the colossal mass
that is Inolis as the surrounding land is relatively barren and not suited for agriculture .
Many miles to the south is the Dune Sea and many tales exist of great sandstorms wiping out
entire villages, horrendous monsters emerging from the sands to pull the living to their doom.
These are considered tall-tales, meant to scare children, by the city-dwellers of Inolis.
As a great display of their relative wealth and power, the ruling class commissioned two
gargantuan statues, carved from the cliff-side rock at the entrance to Clearwater Bay. The
statues depict a human and a dwarf, both holding giant, cut gems. These gems are in reality
giant lighthouses that guide passing ships into the bay safely. Collectively they are known as the
Wardens of Inolis, as without them many ships would run aground on the treacherous rocks
surrounding the bay and their coin would sink into the depths and be no good to anyone.
The council, and hence the city, has a long-standing fear of mages and sorcerers. As such,
arcane magic is officially banned within the city limits and enforced by a special squad of guards
known as the Cowled Inquisitors. Exceptions can be made by those "Trusted by the Council" but
the penalties can range from a fine to death by burning if the offence is serious enough.
The city has the following main districts within it:
 Bridge District
 Temple District
 Government District
 City Gates
 Slums
 Graveyard District
 Waukeen's Promenade (a large marketplace)
 Docks
The promenade is a prominent, oval-shaped marketplace, located in the heart of Inolis
The Dome of the Rose, monastery and temple to Lathander is another significant religious
structure located in the city's Gem District. The three-story temple hall is capped with a dome of
rose tinted glass that glows at dawn during morning song and prayer services.
Moonhall is a seven-sided conical temple to Selune in the Wave District located near the
waterfront
