#Introduction & Background
Stationed in Ardev to assist in peacekeeping along the Breland-Droaam border, Cyrah oversaw
many units as a tactical advisor and informant. Though her ancestors were migrants from the
continent of Sarlona, Cyrah feels a tight, but grim bond to the people of Breland having spent
most of her life here fighting in the Last War.
Cyrah’s aptitude for controlling the intel of the area became
noteworthy beyond the confines of the military camp, and she
was selected to be a court guard. Despite the allure of
complicated political intrigue, she instead declined the post to
continue serving the common people. Upon return, she found
her position usurped by a blow-in from the central army. Cyrah
joins an adventuring group travelling through the area, eager for
the autonomy a small group grants. Cyrah hopes adventuring
may prove more successful in the endless quest to oust evil
from the continent.

# Religion
Cyrah is a staunch worshipper of the Sovereign Host, however like many in
the region, she lends certain gods more favour than others. Cryah often
prays to the vast wisdom of Aureon, or to Boldrei to look over her flock, but
above all, she respects Dol Dorn, who purged the Dark Six from the
pantheon.
Around her neck lays a bronze amulet in the shape of a longsword and
shield, the symbol of Dol Dorn. She is adamant that it and her faith have guided her from
misfortune and to success on the battlefield many a time.
Many have tried to convert Cyrah to the Silver Flame, but the heavy handed approach to
ousting evil leaves no room for compromise, negotiation being crucial in her line of work, though
Cyrah tends to delegate diplomacy to more eloquent soldiers

# Law
Years of military training has made Cyrah kneel to the enduring force of regional governance. A
model soldier, Cyrah was certain to ensure no one above her post was left wanting, ironically, it
was this serving attitude that left her prowess unnoticed for so long.
Despite this, Cyrah will still bow to higher powers and Breland law, sure in the knowledge that
the law has the best interests of the people at heart, though perhaps not always apparent. She
is a firm believer that while the law may not be always right, its presence ensures that everyone
plays by the same rules... at least in theory.
Even the monstrous beings beyond the border have some semblance of law, yet to be refined to
as sophisticated a system as Breland’s.

#Language
Living close to Zilargo, Cyrah has picked up many words of gnomish through haggling for
resources and de-escalating tenuous situations.
Years of infiltration and information extraction tuned her tongue to goblin speak too, for those
were always the first to talk - though they usually knew little of note.

# Opinions of the War
Despite seeing both sides of warforged during the war, Cyrah remains wary of the robotic race -
not for their fabric of character, but for their inhumanity. Separating the warforged from the war
is impossible for her, as the unwavering masks of Indiscriminate killers instantly come to mind
when they pass her view. Cyrah was against the Treaty of Thronehold, but resigned protests
after the nations’ decision.
The so-called “Lord of the Blades” is of particular insult to her, its worship a mockery of mortal
religion. Such happenings are sure to further corrode the already strained bonds of the nations.
So much rumours and propaganda spread of the Day of Mourning that it has been hard to form
a solid opinion on the matter. Cyrah’s hunch is of an unmentioned facility of the warforged, or of
a creation far more lethal than the warforged, should it be possible. The politics of countries is
far above her rank though, and she wouldn’t be surprised if the event was a strategic threat from
an involved group - many noblemen and officials seemed to be coincidentally missing from Cyre
at the time...
Regardless, the mournland is now a place of despair and desolation, and should be cleansed,
though such a job would require a huge force.
