When Wonderdraft Cartography tool launched, a big community began - Many looking for different custom assets. In collaboration with one of the members, who provided a load of artwork, we released several packs of map icons, each with 100,000s of images each. These were generated from the provided templates using the [Assetizer tool](https://github.com/ianfhunter/custom-asset-scripts-wonderdraft) I created.

It has since been open sourced to the public for general consumption and has a few additional modes, including converting city maps for the wonderdraft platform.
