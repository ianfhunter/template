summary: Optimizing Web Content Download in Low-Performance Networks.
---

For my Final Year Project, I designed, implemented & evaluated several exploratory techniques in an attempt to alleviate access costs of low-throughput or congested networks, such as those found in developing countries or crowded stadiums.

The system consisted of several component areas that were developed on, including a both a remote and local proxy and on the browser itself. The system was developed in a combination of Python, Javascript, Node.JS and HTML.

Techniques used include Vision-based auto-vectorization, semantic content removal and compression

At the end of the four-month period, we pitched our projects to a judging panel and the rest of the class. After this, there was a Q&A Session assisted by a poster design. I was an honorable mention for the pitch and won the best poster session award.
