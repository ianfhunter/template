Androkon is a convention organiser app for android, aiming to detail all the animation and videogame related conventions around Ireland.  
  
The aim of this app is to reduce the amount of timetables, maps and other sheets of paper you might bring - and store them all in the convenience of your pocket.  
  
This project was created for free and is also free of advertisements, Androkon was built with the sole purpose of gaining experience and building an app that I would use myself.  
  
I built Androkon mostly over Summer 2012 and it is still continuing development.The app is popular both with the convention organisers and with the users themselves, the current userbase in in the 100-500 category on the Google Play store and is still growing.  
  
Along the way, some of my friends pitched in various aspects of the program, helping create a web interface and syncing database system. This was part of a Software Engineering Project that Trinity College Dublin allowed to be developed for their Computer Science students, alongside projects for larger companies like Microsoft and Corvil.  
  
Pitched to the Trinity LaunchBox incubator as a potential business and made the final 10.
